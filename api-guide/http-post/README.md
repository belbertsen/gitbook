# HTTP POST

Itâ€™s possible to communicate to the HTTP handler through an HTTP POST request. Within the HTTP POST specific data using key-value pairs are required in the message and send an XML string as a single parameter that includes all the objects structured in XML format.

The receiving client should parse the HTTP POST response data and extract the XML that was constructed by Ultimo Business Integration containing all the object data.
